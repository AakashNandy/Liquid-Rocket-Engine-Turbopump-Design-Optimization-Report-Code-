### **Project Overview & Executive Summary**

This project establishes an automated Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) pipeline for a high-pressure, liquid oxygen (LOX) rocket engine turbopump stage. The architecture closes the loop between first-principles analytical sizing, automated heuristic optimization, 3D parametric computer-aided design (CAD), and multi-domain Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within an integrated ANSYS Workbench environment.

### **Core Pipeline Methodology**

#### **1. 1D Meanline Analytical Modeling (MATLAB)**

* **Kinematic & Thermodynamic Formulation:** Formulated a meanline solver based on Euler's turbomachinery equations and velocity triangles to predict theoretical Euler head, blade loading, and shaft torque.


* **Real-Fluid Thermophysical Properties:** Coupled the solver with **CoolProp** to evaluate subcooled LOX properties (density $\rho$, kinematic viscosity $\nu$, and saturation vapor pressure $P_{\text{vap}}$) dynamically as functions of local temperature ($T = 85\text{--}90\text{ K}$) and suction pressure, preventing fixed-density sizing errors.


* **Cavitation & Inducer Coupling:** Sized an axial inducer stage preceding the centrifugal impeller eye to provide an initial static head rise ($\Delta P_{\text{ind}} \approx 4.8\text{ bar}$), raising the Net Positive Suction Head Available ($NPSH_A$) to safely exceed the Required Suction Head ($NPSH_R$).


* **Empirical Screening & Deviation:** Solved for blade metal angles ($\beta_{1B}$, $\beta_{2B}$) through an implicit root-finding formulation incorporating El-Naggar and Stodola slip factor corrections, while enforcing the NASA SP-8109 Cordier curve ($0.75 \le D_s / D_{s,\text{opt}} \le 1.35$) to reject unphysical geometries prone to boundary layer stalling.



#### **2. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Optimization**

* **Constrained Fitness Landscape:** Deployed a parallelized Genetic Algorithm (`ga`) using non-dimensional geometric ratios ($b_2/d_2$, $d_{\text{eye}}/d_2$, $b_1/d_{\text{eye}}$) as bounded decision variables, enforcing physically viable velocity triangles across candidate designs.


* **Proportional Penalty Formulation:** Guided convergence through an objective function combining efficiency maximization with continuous proportional penalties targeting pressure rise ($15 \times \vert{}\Delta P_{\text{actual}} - 75.0\text{ bar}\vert{}$), Cordier line deviations, and a step penalty (+200) for cavitation failure.


* **Execution & Output:** Evaluated candidate geometries across 300 generations, isolating a baseline design point:
* **Shaft Speed:** $28,000\text{--}30,896\text{ RPM}$

* **Stage Total Pressure Rise:** $75.0\text{--}76.26\text{ bar}$

* **Impeller Outer Diameter ($d_2$):** $78.0\text{--}81.33\text{ mm}$

* **Impeller Blade Count ($Z$):** 7–8 backward-curved blades


* **Cordier Specific Diameter Ratio ($D_s / D_{s,\text{opt}}$):** $1.05\text{--}1.14$ (PASS)


* **Cavitation Margin:** $NPSH_A \approx 81.9\text{ m}$ vs. $NPSH_R = 4.5\text{ m}$ ($>75\text{ m}$ safety margin).





#### **3. Parametric 3D CAD Generation (CFturbo)**

* **Geometric Translation:** Direct porting of 1D meanline parameters into **CFturbo** to generate fully parametric 3D blade profiles, meridional hub/shroud contours, and a circular cross-section volute collector scaled to conserve angular momentum.


* **Automated Boundary Tagging:** Pre-configured CFturbo Workbench Named Selections (using prefix filtering) to expose geometric faces (blades, hub, shroud, cut-water) directly to downstream meshing modules.



#### **4. Automated 3D Simulation & MDO Loop (ANSYS Workbench)**

* **Multi-Domain Meshing Strategy:** Routed rotating helical inducer passages into **ANSYS TurboGrid** for boundary-layer-resolved hexahedral grids with sector periodicity, while routing the centrifugal impeller and casing into **SpaceClaim / ANSYS Meshing**.


* **Hydrodynamic Verification (ANSYS CFX):** Conducted steady-state 3D Navier-Stokes analyses applying the $k$-$\omega$ SST turbulence model and frozen rotor / mixing-plane interfaces between rotating and stationary domains.


* **Optimization Closure (optiSLang / DesignXplorer):** Formulated a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) Design of Experiments (DoE) driving bi-directional parameter updates in CFturbo (varying blade wrap and trailing-edge angles $\beta_{2,\text{hub}}$, $\beta_{2,\text{shroud}}$) to optimize hydraulic efficiency while monitoring local minimum pressure ($P_{\min} > P_{\text{sat}}$) to eliminate 3D cavitation cores.

### **Downstream Multiphysics & Verification**

* **Structural Integrity (ANSYS Mechanical FEA):** One-way Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) mapping 3D static pressure fields and centrifugal loads onto solid blade/hub domains to verify yield safety margins at 120% operational overspeed (33,600 RPM).


* **Rotordynamics & Modal Analysis:** Critical speed calculations targeting subcritical operation with a 1st bending critical speed margin $\ge 140\text{--}150\%$ of nominal operating speed, consistent with turbomachinery design practice.


* **Acoustics & NVH:** Spectral evaluation of unsteady blade-pass frequencies ($BPF = Z \times \omega / 60$) to prevent structural acoustic lock-in with volute cut-water pressure pulsations.
